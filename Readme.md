# NOSQL Challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I have been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, *Eat Safe, Love*, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

The exercise contains two main parts. In the first part, namely NoSQL\_setup, basic queries and operations were done that included, find, insert, update, count, and printing. In the second part, advanced queries were constructed using various operators, and the results were converted to pandas data frames. Lastly, aggregated queries were constructed to form a pipeline query, convert to pandas data frame and print.
